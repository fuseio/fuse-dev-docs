### Purpose <a href="#_6ttwh8x4ofm1" id="_6ttwh8x4ofm1"></a>

The purpose of this document is to provide you a quick overview of Snapshot and how it functions. It also gives you all the information you need to get started with voting on Fuse Proposals.

### Overview <a href="#_vidcw2oqms3a" id="_vidcw2oqms3a"></a>

Snapshot is a voting tool based on the IPFS decentralized storage system that is utilized by numerous crypto projects to survey their user communities. It gives flexibility with regard to the calculation of voting power for a vote. Snapshot allows organizations to choose from a variety of voting options to meet their specific requirements. Snapshot's proposal and voting method is simple to use and doesn't use any gas, unlike older ballot systems, which do.

### What Makes Snapshot Unique? <a href="#_4jn6pyr996q9" id="_4jn6pyr996q9"></a>

Cryptocurrency projects, in the past, must construct the polling infrastructure themselves or utilize centralized approaches. These approaches are time-consuming and can be manipulated by people with ulterior motives. Snapshot allows projects to ask their most committed token holders or validators for decisions.

It uses IPFS Network to create and store votes. Snapshot can utilize a blockchain to record poll responses without the typical transaction fees because these transactions donâ€™t go through the blockchain; instead they are saved in the decentralized IPFS storage network. The poll maker can track votes using an interface as the voting commences.
